# Pdf Bookmarking python program
 Create bookmarks in a pdf.\
 The supplied txt file "bookmark_input_text_file_example.txt" shows an example of how to provide input.\
 The string of characters on the left of the "@" symbol will become the title of the bookmark, and the integer on the right will denote the page number.\
 For simplicity, the program doesn't use csv or excel files but text file.\
 Perhaps it will be advantageous if the page number are in ascending order in the text file. This was not tested.
 The destination folder should also be empty.
